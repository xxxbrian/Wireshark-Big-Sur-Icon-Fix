    Qt: ElidedLabel escapes HTML

    ElidedLabel escapes HTML after !9261, so use its own methods to make text
    small and italicized instead of passing in rich text.

    IOGraphDialog used to make an error message, if it existed, bold.
    Perhaps ElidedLabel should have a way to have prepended bold
    text for such usage.

    Qt: Sort strings, like GeoIP country or city, in Endpoints

    QVariant canConvert<double>() does not test that a particular QVariant
    value can be converted to a double, but only that at least some values
    of that type can convert. (Just checking the type is much faster than
    actually trying the conversion; this is why convert() has a boolean
    output parameter as well.) It thus always returns TRUE for strings even
    for strings that fail to convert, and is not by itself a useful test
    when trying to sort unknown types.

    Luckily, we don't need to test this anyway. Set the default data role used
    for sorting to UNFORMATTED_DISPLAYDATA, so the parent QSortFilterProxyModel
    will handle QVariants that are numbers appropriately. In particular,
    this makes the GeoIP city and country column strings in the Endpoints
    table sort correctly.

    Qt: Fix test for appending rows to UAT tables

    We want to return with failure when the number of entries in

    The IO Graph is the only place that uses appendEntry, and this
    allows adding IO Graphs past the tenth graph.

    [branch-4.0] packet-cql: keys with length -1 are NULL values

    When procssing results, Wireshark did not properly handled keys with length -1, which actually means NULL.
    This fixes it (and as a results, parses properly some result packets it failed to parse properly before).

    (Same fix as https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/merge_requests/9266 that went to master branch)

    cli: Fix copying global profile to personal at startup

    Fix up commit 1eeb0c99345701dd5698a5a36ff8f87857422b02
    At initial startup, the hash of configuration files used
    by profiles doesn't exist yet or is not completely filled.
    (Files are only added to the list after initially parsing
    the current configuration.)

    So, if copying a global profile to the personal directory
    at initial startup, just copy all the files from the global
    profile.

    Also, don't free to_dir and from_dir if we're returning them
    in the case of errors.

    protobuf: Do not crash on zero length bytes element

    If a field name has been written to the json dumper for
    a bytes element (Base64), then a Base64 value must be written
    later, even if the value is zero length.

    Move the JSON_DUMPER_FLAGS_NO_DEBUG flag to the json_dumper header,
    and use it in the protobuf dissector, so that errors in the JSON
    dumper state transitions do not abort the application through a
    ws_error() call. Use DISSECTOR_ASSERT in that case, since it should
    happen only with a dissector bug (as with the zero bytes elements
    issue fixed here), not with malformed packets.

    Only instantiate the json_dumper and create its output string if
    we intend on displaying its output, instead of doing so whenever
    we have a message type name.

    Fix #18730.

    NBAP: Add UEID to HS-DSCH flows added from RadioLinkReconfiguration

    A few HS-DSCH conversations are created when calling add_hsdsch_bind,
    such as when a RadioLinkReconfigurationPrepare procedure has
    a id-HSDSCH-MACdFlows-to-Add element. This method should add
    the CommunicationContextID to the conversation just like the
    other ways of creating the conversation. This provides a UEID
    for a unique key for RLC reassembly.
