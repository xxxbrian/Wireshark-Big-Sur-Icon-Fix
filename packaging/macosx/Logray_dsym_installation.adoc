== Debugging Symbols for Logray

This archive contains the debugging symbols for Logray {logray-version}.
The debugging symbols are only necessary if Logray is crashing and you need to report an issue to the Logray development team.

WARNING: This won't work properly with any version other than Logray {logray-version}.

To install the symbols, drag _Logray.dSYM_ to the same location as _Logray_.
This is usually your _Applications_ folder.

To uninstall, drag _Logray.dSYM_ to the trash.
